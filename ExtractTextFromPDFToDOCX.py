# Description: 
# This program extracts text from a PDF file and dumps it into a newly created DOCX file.
# It is done character per character and maintains bold and/or italic formatting.
#
# How to use:
# Provide the full path of the directory where the PDF file is located and
# the full name of the PDF file in the respective fields of the user interface, then click "Extract".
# A new DOCX file will be created in the same directory with the same name.
